# My Essential Developer Tools Stack for 2024

As a developer, having the right tools can make the difference between a productive day and a frustrating one. Here's my current toolkit that keeps me efficient and happy while coding.

## Code Editors & IDEs

### Visual Studio Code
Still the king of code editors in 2024. The extension ecosystem is unmatched, and the built-in terminal, Git integration, and debugging tools make it a complete development environment.

**Must-have extensions:**
- GitLens
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Live Server
- Thunder Client (for API testing)

### JetBrains IDEs
For language-specific development, nothing beats JetBrains IDEs. WebStorm for JavaScript, PyCharm for Python, and IntelliJ for Java provide incredible language support.

## Terminal & Command Line

### Homebrew (macOS)
The essential package manager for macOS. Makes installing development tools a breeze.

```bash
# Install multiple tools at once
brew install git node python ruby
```

### Oh My Zsh
Transforms the terminal experience with themes, plugins, and aliases that boost productivity.

## Version Control

### Git + GitHub
The foundation of modern development. GitHub's improved interface and features like Codespaces and Actions make it even more powerful.

**Pro tip:** Use GitHub CLI for faster workflow:
```bash
gh repo create my-new-project --public
gh pr create --title "New feature" --body "Description"
```

## API Development & Testing

### Postman
Still the go-to for API testing and documentation. The collaboration features are excellent for team projects.

### Thunder Client (VS Code Extension)
A lightweight alternative to Postman that lives inside VS Code. Perfect for quick API tests.

## Database Tools

### TablePlus
Beautiful, fast database client that supports multiple database types. The query interface is intuitive and powerful.

## Deployment & Hosting

### Vercel
For frontend applications, Vercel provides the smoothest deployment experience. Git integration and automatic previews are game-changers.

### GitHub Pages
Perfect for static sites and documentation. This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages!

## Productivity

### Notion
All-in-one workspace for notes, project planning, and documentation. The database features are particularly useful for tracking projects.

### Raycast (macOS)
Spotlight replacement that's incredibly fast and extensible. Custom workflows and snippets save hours every week.

## What's in Your Toolkit?

Every developer's toolkit is unique and evolves over time. What tools are essential to your workflow? I'm always looking for new tools that can improve productivity.

The key is finding tools that complement your workflow rather than complicating it. Start with the basics and gradually add tools as you identify specific needs.

Happy coding! 🛠️
